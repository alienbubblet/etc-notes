## about %
 - SL-list stands for should-learn list
 - keep a record of sth I consider important or worth my time
 - also a practice of github-flavored markdown language
 - to-project entries not included

## format
 - each entry/ sub-entry starts with a symbol (or ebol)
 - an ebol indicates the main category of the entry, as in...
 	- "-" indicates a common entry
		- checked or unchecked, it is "common" anyway
 	- "*" important and checked
	- "." important but unchecked
	- and research on each entry is stored somewhere else
 - indentation
