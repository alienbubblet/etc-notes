 - software center ... where did it install dictionary trainer..

 - find / -name "*dict*" -executable 2> temp.txt # | grep "sth"
 	- can not find the dictrain :XDD:
	- alias find-dtrainer="find / -name "*dict*" -executable 2>temp_p_p.txt_t_t ; rm temp_p_p_p.txt_t_t"
	- alias is actually quite interestingly ambigious ..
	- alias dtrainer=/opt/dictionary-trainer/bin/dictrain.exe

 - to-project: a table formatting program? can be used along with vim ~?

 - to-project: A book with multiple sections, mainly sorted in contente (chapters) and release (difficulty).
 	- A book/ article should not be divided into chapters according to contents only. Instead, we should also count the difficulty, version (in the sense of time), and version (in the sense of release), difficulty. Especially difficulty: we do not read a book line by line but again and again. (By read I mean not just literally but to study and understand.)

 	- It has been more than 2 years since I knew the virtual machine stuff. I wrongly chose to use dynamic virtual hard drive, leading to terrible performance running the virtual machine. So VM did not interest me at all in the first place ...
	- 2014OS hw1 brings up the need of POSIX OS again, leaving no choice to use the VM that I used to consider terrible-performanced. But ... when I use 2014OS.vdi provided by tr, it turns out tobe perfectly fine!!!!! Why the hell did I choose dynamic HD instead of static one :-_____-:
	- I download Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and re-install one on vbox right away ~~~~~ That is the VM I want!!!! And spent all day playing Ubuntu :-v-:.
